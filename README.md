DaveDaveFind is a simple search engine based on the web crawler developed in the [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/) CS101 course. It is built with the [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) web framework by Marcel Hellkamp and designed to run on Google App Engine. The web crawler script `udacity_crawler.py`, located in the directory `/crawler/`, uses [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), an HTML parsing library by Leonard Richardson.
